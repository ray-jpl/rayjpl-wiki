## Binary Search Tree (BST)
Binary Search Trees(BST) are [[notes/Tree (Graph Theory)]] that have a left subtree that only contains values smaller than the root node, the right subtree only contains values greater than the root node.

## Common traversal methods
Often times you may need to traverse the entire BST to solve the problem so I have compiled common methods.
