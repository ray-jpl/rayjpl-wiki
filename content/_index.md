Hi, I'm Raymond! I'm a computer science student at UNSW.

This is my personal notes/wiki website. Learning new things is something that I love doing but keeping track of the notes I write during learning is difficult. Often times I would have information split between various platforms and they all felt somewhat inflexible at connecting ideas smoothly. I discovered [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) for taking notes that seemed to be an effective approach to build a comprehensive knowledge database.

This wiki will contain notes on Computer Science/Software Engineering concepts and anything else I'm learning about. These are my [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) so I hope to be constantly growing this database over time. 

If youre interested in learning more about Obsidian or how I set this website up just visit [[notes/Obsidian Notes]].
